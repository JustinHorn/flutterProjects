Through Luft's observations, only recently made public, and Garland's own words emerges a poignant portrait of a woman whose vulnerabilities were exploited by an industry she helped build, but whose resilience, entrepreneurship and unfailing commitment to her creative gifts kept her fighting. SID & JUDY reminds us why Garland has remained a beacon of perseverance and joy for LGBTQ+ generations and her fans worldwide.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"}],"categories":["Documentary","Biography"],"imageName":"Sid & Judy (2019)"}
