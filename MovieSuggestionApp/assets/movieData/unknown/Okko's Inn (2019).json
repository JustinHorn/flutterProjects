After losing her parents in a car accident, Okko goes to live with her grandmother, who runs a traditional Japanese inn. Okko soon discovers there are spirits that only she can see -- welcoming ghosts who keep her company and help her navigate her new environment. The inn's motto is that it welcomes all and will reject none, and this is soon put to the test as guests challenge Okko's ability to be a gracious host. Ultimately, Okko discovers that dedicating herself to others is the key to taking care of herself. The latest feature from famed anime studio Madhouse and director Kitaro Kosaka blends immersive, idyllic landscapes with storybook charm. Okko's Inn delivers a rare ghost story that is firmly grounded in the trials and joys of humanity. This event will feature both Subtitled and English Dub versions of the film, as well as an exclusive introduction from director Kitar&#333; K&#333;saka!\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"}],"categories":["Special Interest","Adventure","Animation","Drama"],"imageName":"Okko's Inn (2019)"}
