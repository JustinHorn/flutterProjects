The elephants share their home with a cast of supporting character species who provide texture and richness to the elephants' ecosystem - from a toenail height perspective. Athena, as leader of her herd, anticipates the coming dry season and knows there are lean times ahead. As the waterholes dry up, she has no choice but to take her family on a treacherous journey across even more foreboding landscapes, as the majestic creatures seek refuge until the rains fall again.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Really good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Really good"}],"categories":["Art House & International","Documentary","Kids & Family","Family"],"imageName":"The Elephant Queen (2019)"}
