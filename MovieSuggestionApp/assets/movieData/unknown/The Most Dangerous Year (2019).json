Filmmaker Vlada Knowlton captured the ensuing civil rights battle from the perspective of a group of embattled parents -- including herself and her husband, parents of a young trans girl -- fighting to protect their children from discriminatory laws in their home state. While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"Beyond good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Really really good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"}],"categories":["Documentary"],"imageName":"The Most Dangerous Year (2019)"}
