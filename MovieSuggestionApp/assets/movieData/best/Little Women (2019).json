{"id":198,"page":"best","name":"Little Women (2019)","description":"\\n                        Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author's alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life. In Gerwig's take, the beloved story of the March sisters - four young women each determined to live life on her own terms -- is both timeless and timely. Portraying Jo, Meg, Amy, and Beth March, the film stars Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Eliza Scanlen, with Timoth√©e Chalamet as their neighbor Laurie, Laura Dern as Marmee, and Meryl Streep as Aunt March.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Amazingly good"}],"categories":["Drama","Romance"],"imageName":"Little Women (2019)"}
