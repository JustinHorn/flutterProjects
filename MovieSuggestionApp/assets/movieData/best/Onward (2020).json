Like any good quest, their journey is filled with magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries. But when the boys' fearless mom Laurel (voice of Julia Louis-Dreyfus) realizes her sons are missing, she teams up with a part-lion, part-bat, part-scorpion, former warrior -- aka The Manticore (voice of Octavia Spencer) -- and heads off to find them. Perilous curses aside, this one magical day could mean more than any of them ever dreamed.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Really good"}],"categories":["Action & Adventure","Animation","Kids & Family","Science Fiction & Fantasy","Adventure","Comedy"],"imageName":"Onward (2020)"}
