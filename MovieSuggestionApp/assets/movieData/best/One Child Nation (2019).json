From award-winning documentarian Nanfu Wang (Hooligan Sparrow, I Am Another You) and Jialing Zhang, the sweeping One Child Nation explores the ripple effect of this devastating social experiment, uncovering one shocking human rights violation after another -- from abandoned newborns, to forced sterilizations and abortions, and government abductions. Wang digs fearlessly into her own personal life, weaving her experience as a new mother and the firsthand accounts of her family members into archival propaganda material and testimony from victims and perpetrators alike, yielding a revelatory and essential record of this chilling, unprecedented moment in human civilization.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"}],"categories":["Documentary","History"],"imageName":"One Child Nation (2019)"}
