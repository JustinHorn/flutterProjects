{"page":"unknown","name":"Satan & Adam (2019)","description":"\\n                        In 1986, when harmonica player Adam Gussow asked if he could jam with one-man band Sterling \\\"Mr. Satan\\\" Magee, it was the beginning of an unforgettable collaboration--dubbed Satan & Adam. Amidst the racial tension in New York City, this Jewish Ivy League graduate and black Mississippi blues man made an unlikely pair, but their musical stylings perfectly aligned. After a chance encounter with members of U2 and a celebrated debut record, the duo rose to international acclaim from their Harlem street corner. But as quickly as they were discovered, their meteoric rise was cut short when Mr. Satan mysteriously disappeared. The result is an odyssey 23 years in the making that captures a miraculous journey of friendship, heartbreak and the transformative power of music.\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"Really really good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Good"}],"categories":["Documentary","Music"],"imageName":"Satan & Adam (2019)"}
