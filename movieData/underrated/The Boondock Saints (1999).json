Brothers Conner and Murphy MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) take to performing their divine duty against the Russian mob. They massacre a bunch of unsuspecting Mafioso in a scene of absurd violence, then they let more blood in a mass killing of porn-shop customers. Instead of getting thrown in jail, they are dubbed \\\"saints\\\" by the Boston Herald, and they are praised by brilliant, tortured, and gay FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe). ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi\\n                    ","ratings":[{"critic":"RT critics","rating":"Really bad"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"The best"},{"critic":"RT audience","rating":"Really really good"}],"categories":["Action & Adventure","Comedy","Drama","Mystery & Suspense","Action","Crime","Thriller"],"imageName":"The Boondock Saints (1999)"}
